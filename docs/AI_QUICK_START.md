# ü§ñ AI Quick Start - MunLink Zambales

> **READ THIS FIRST** before implementing ANYTHING. This is your 5-minute validation checklist.

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Implementation Validation Checklist

### 1. Core Project Facts (30 seconds)

```yaml
‚úì Project: MunLink Zambales
‚úì Type: Multi-tenant municipal governance platform
‚úì Geography: Zambales Province ONLY (NO other provinces)
‚úì Municipalities: EXACTLY 13 (no cities, no other provinces)
‚úì Architecture: Monorepo with 3 separate apps
‚úì Database: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (development)
‚úì Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
‚úì Backend: Flask + SQLAlchemy + JWT authentication
```

### 2. The 13 Municipalities (MEMORIZE THIS)

```python
# EXACTLY 13 municipalities - NO MORE, NO LESS
ZAMBALES_MUNICIPALITIES = [
    "Botolan",        # 1
    "Cabangan",       # 2
    "Candelaria",     # 3
    "Castillejos",    # 4
    "Iba",            # 5 - Provincial Capital
    "Masinloc",       # 6
    "Palauig",        # 7
    "San Antonio",    # 8
    "San Felipe",     # 9
    "San Marcelino",  # 10
    "San Narciso",    # 11
    "Santa Cruz",     # 12
    "Subic",          # 13
]

# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED: Olongapo City (it's a city, not a municipality)
# ‚úÖ COUNT CHECK: len(ZAMBALES_MUNICIPALITIES) == 13
```

### 3. Technology Stack - MANDATORY (NO ALTERNATIVES)

```yaml
Backend (apps/api):
  ‚úì Flask 3.0+ (not Django, FastAPI, Express)
  ‚úì SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (not Prisma, TypeORM, Mongoose)
  ‚úì PostgreSQL 15+ (not MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite in prod)
  ‚úì JWT with bcrypt (not session-based, not Passport)
  ‚úì Python 3.10+ (not Node.js, not PHP)

Frontend (apps/web & apps/admin):
  ‚úì React 18+ (not Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js)
  ‚úì TypeScript 5+ (not plain JavaScript)
  ‚úì Vite 5+ (not Webpack, CRA, Parcel)
  ‚úì Tailwind CSS 3+ (not Bootstrap, Material-UI, Chakra)
  ‚úì Node.js 18+ (for build tools)

Monorepo:
  ‚úì Turborepo (not Lerna, Nx, Rush, pnpm workspaces)
  ‚úì npm workspaces (not yarn, pnpm)

DO NOT suggest alternatives. These are FINAL.
```

### 4. Scope Boundaries

```diff
‚úÖ IN SCOPE (IMPLEMENT THESE):
+ Zambales Province
+ 13 municipalities (complete list above)
+ Municipal-level services (NOT provincial)
+ Cross-municipal marketplace ONLY
+ Document request system
+ Issue reporting system
+ Benefits management
+ QR code validation
+ Two-tier user verification (email ‚Üí admin ID)
+ Age-based access control (18+ for marketplace)

‚ùå OUT OF SCOPE (DO NOT ADD):
- Other provinces beyond Zambales
- Cities (Olongapo is excluded)
- Provincial-level administration
- National government integration
- Barangay-level features
- Payment processing (marketplace is free exchange)
- Real-time chat (use async messaging)
- Blockchain/AI/ML features
- Mobile native apps (web-responsive only)
- Social media features (only marketplace feed)
```

### 5. Critical Architecture Rules

```yaml
Data Isolation:
  - Each municipality's data is ISOLATED
  - Users belong to ONE municipality only
  - Document requests go to HOME municipality
  - Issues reported to HOME municipality
  - Benefits managed by HOME municipality

Cross-Municipal Sharing:
  - Marketplace items visible across ALL 13 municipalities
  - Users can transact across municipality boundaries
  - NO other cross-municipal features

Access Levels:
  - No email verification: No access
  - Email verified, under 18: Read-only marketplace
  - Email verified, 18+, not admin-verified: Basic marketplace
  - Email + admin verified, 18+: Full municipal services
```

---

## üö® Critical Anti-Patterns (WHAT NOT TO DO)

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern 1: Adding Features Not in Specification

```python
# WRONG - Adding provincial administration
@app.route('/api/province/admin')
def province_admin():
    pass

# WRONG - Adding payment processing
@app.route('/api/marketplace/payment')
def process_payment():
    pass

# WRONG - Adding other provinces
@app.route('/api/provinces')  # Should be ONLY Zambales
def get_all_provinces():
    pass

# CORRECT - Stay within spec
@app.route('/api/municipalities')
def get_zambales_municipalities():
    # Returns ONLY the 13 Zambales municipalities
    pass
```

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern 2: Using Alternative Technologies

```javascript
// WRONG - Vue instead of React
import { createApp } from 'vue'

// WRONG - Material-UI instead of Tailwind
import { Button } from '@mui/material'

// WRONG - Webpack config
module.exports = { /* webpack config */ }

// CORRECT - Use specified stack
import React from 'react'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
// Use Tailwind classes: className="bg-blue-500"
```

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern 3: Hardcoding Municipality Data

```python
# WRONG - Hardcoded list
municipalities = ["Iba", "Botolan"]  # Incomplete!

# WRONG - Including cities
municipalities = ["Iba", "Olongapo", "Botolan"]  # Olongapo is a CITY

# CORRECT - Load from data source
def load_zambales_municipalities_from_json():
    """
    Load municipalities from philippines_full_locations.json
    Filter for:
    - province == 'Zambales'
    - level == 'municipality'
    - name in [list of 13 municipalities]
    """
    # Returns exactly 13 municipalities
    pass
```

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern 4: Breaking Data Isolation

```python
# WRONG - Cross-municipal document access
@app.route('/api/documents/all')
def get_all_documents():
    # Returns documents from ALL municipalities
    pass

# CORRECT - Municipal isolation
@app.route('/api/documents/requests')
@require_auth
def get_user_documents():
    user = g.current_user
    # Returns ONLY documents from user's home municipality
    return DocumentRequest.query.filter_by(
        municipality_id=user.municipality_id,
        user_id=user.id
    ).all()
```

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern 5: Incorrect Access Control

```python
# WRONG - No age verification for marketplace
@app.route('/api/marketplace/items', methods=['POST'])
@require_auth  # Not enough!
def create_item():
    pass

# CORRECT - Age + verification checks
@app.route('/api/marketplace/items', methods=['POST'])
@require_auth
@require_email_verified
@require_age(18)  # Must be 18+
def create_item():
    pass
```

## ‚úÖ Implementation Validation Steps

### Step 1: Validate Conceptual Understanding (2 minutes)

```bash
# Ask yourself these questions:

1. How many municipalities? 
   ‚úì Answer: EXACTLY 13

2. Is Olongapo included?
   ‚úì Answer: NO (it's a city)

3. Can users from Iba access documents from Botolan?
   ‚úì Answer: NO (municipal data isolation)

4. Can users from Iba see marketplace items from Botolan?
   ‚úì Answer: YES (marketplace is cross-municipal)

5. What happens if user is under 18?
   ‚úì Answer: Read-only marketplace, no services

6. What happens if email not verified?
   ‚úì Answer: No access at all

7. Can we use Vue.js instead of React?
   ‚úì Answer: NO (React is mandatory)

8. Can we add provincial-level features?
   ‚úì Answer: NO (municipal level only)

9. How many apps in the monorepo?
   ‚úì Answer: 3 (web, admin, api)

10. Is admin dashboard publicly accessible?
    ‚úì Answer: NO (internal network only)
```

### Step 2: Validate Database Design (2 minutes)

```python
# Check database models have:

‚úì Municipality model with exactly 13 records
‚úì User model with municipality_id (foreign key)
‚úì User model with email_verified (Tier 1)
‚úì User model with is_verified (Tier 2)
‚úì User model with date_of_birth (age verification)
‚úì Item model with municipality_id (for attribution)
‚úì Item model visible across municipalities (cross-municipal)
‚úì DocumentRequest model with municipality_id (isolation)
‚úì Issue model with municipality_id (isolation)
‚úì Benefit model with municipality_id (isolation)
‚úì QRCode model for document verification
‚úì Transaction model for marketplace
‚úì Message model for in-app communication
‚úì ActivityLog model for audit trail
‚úì Notification model for user alerts
```

### Step 3: Validate API Endpoints (2 minutes)

```yaml
# Essential endpoints that MUST exist:

Authentication:
  ‚úì POST /api/auth/register
  ‚úì POST /api/auth/verify-email
  ‚úì POST /api/auth/login
  ‚úì POST /api/users/profile/government-id

Municipalities:
  ‚úì GET /api/municipalities (returns 13)
  ‚úì GET /api/municipalities/<id>

Marketplace (cross-municipal):
  ‚úì GET /api/marketplace/items (all municipalities)
  ‚úì POST /api/marketplace/items
  ‚úì POST /api/marketplace/transactions

Documents (municipal-isolated):
  ‚úì POST /api/documents/requests (home municipality only)
  ‚úì GET /api/documents/requests (own requests only)

Benefits (municipal-isolated):
  ‚úì GET /api/benefits/programs/<municipality_id>
  ‚úì POST /api/benefits/applications

Issues (municipal-isolated):
  ‚úì POST /api/issues/submit (home municipality)
  ‚úì GET /api/issues/municipality/<id>

QR Validation:
  ‚úì POST /api/qr/validate
  ‚úì GET /api/qr/<token>

Admin (internal only):
  ‚úì POST /api/admin/create-admin (with secret key)
  ‚úì PUT /api/users/admin/<user_id>/verify-id
```

### Step 4: Validate Access Control Logic (1 minute)

```python
# Access control must implement:

‚úì JWT token validation on protected routes
‚úì Email verification check for basic access
‚úì Admin ID verification check for full services
‚úì Age verification (18+) for marketplace actions
‚úì Municipality ownership check for isolated data
‚úì Admin role check for admin endpoints
‚úì No hardcoded credentials (use environment variables)
‚úì Password hashing with bcrypt
‚úì Token blacklisting on logout
```

## üéØ Asset Files Handling

When building the monorepo, you'll need these asset files:

### Location Data
- **Source**: `philippines_full_locations.json`
- **Location**: Project root or data directory
- **Usage**: Seed database with 13 Zambales municipalities
- **Filter**: `province == 'Zambales' AND level == 'municipality'`
- **Expected Count**: 13 municipalities

### Municipal Logos
- **Source**: Logo directories for each municipality
- **Usage**: Document generation, UI branding
- **Requirement**: Each municipality needs seal/logo file
- **Format**: PNG preferred, various sizes available

### UI Assets
- **Hero Images**: For landing page backgrounds
- **Municipal Trademarks**: Landmark photos for each municipality
- **Usage**: Branding and visual identity

### How to Reference Assets in Code

```python
# apps/api/utils/assets.py
from pathlib import Path
import os

# Get project root (2 levels up from this file)
PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent

# Asset directories
LOCATION_DATA_FILE = PROJECT_ROOT / "philippines_full_locations.json"
LOGO_BASE_DIR = PROJECT_ROOT / "municipal_logos"
UI_ASSETS_DIR = PROJECT_ROOT / "ui_assets"

# Function to load location data
def load_municipalities():
    """Load 13 Zambales municipalities from JSON"""
    import json
    
    if not LOCATION_DATA_FILE.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(
            f"Location data file not found: {LOCATION_DATA_FILE}\n"
            "Please ensure philippines_full_locations.json is in project root."
        )
    
    with open(LOCATION_DATA_FILE) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    
    # Filter for Zambales municipalities
    municipalities = [
        item for item in data
        if item.get('province') == 'Zambales'
        and item.get('level') == 'municipality'
        and item.get('name') in [
            'Botolan', 'Cabangan', 'Candelaria', 'Castillejos',
            'Iba', 'Masinloc', 'Palauig', 'San Antonio',
            'San Felipe', 'San Marcelino', 'San Narciso',
            'Santa Cruz', 'Subic'
        ]
    ]
    
    # Validate count
    if len(municipalities) != 13:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Expected 13 municipalities, found {len(municipalities)}. "
            "Check data file."
        )
    
    return municipalities

# Function to get municipality logo
def get_municipality_logo(municipality_name: str) -> Path:
    """Get logo file path for municipality"""
    logo_path = LOGO_BASE_DIR / municipality_name / "seal.png"
    
    if not logo_path.exists():
        # Fallback or raise error
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Logo not found for {municipality_name}")
    
    return logo_path
```
