## MunLink Zambales — Admin User Guide (Live System)

This guide helps Municipal Admins use the MunLink Admin Portal on the live, deployed system.

### Access
- Admin Portal: use the official MunLink Admin Portal URL provided by your LGU IT (single admin portal). Example: `https://admin.munlink.zambales.gov.ph`.
- Sign in using your assigned admin credentials. If you do not have access, contact your municipal IT lead.

### Roles & Scope
- Admin actions are scoped to your municipality.
- Only authorized staff should access the Admin Portal. Keep credentials private.

## Overview
After login, you will see the admin dashboard with key panels and navigation.

Main areas:
- Dashboard
- Residents (Verification)
- Requests (Documents)
- Issues
- Marketplace
- Announcements
- Benefits
- Reports/Analytics (if enabled)
- Profile

---

## Resident Verification
Purpose: verify resident identities to unlock municipality services.

Workflow:
1. Open Residents/Verification.
2. Review pending accounts: check ID photos, profile details, and any notes.
3. Approve or Reject:
   - Approve: resident becomes fully verified (can submit requests, post listings, etc.)
   - Reject: add a clear rejection reason and, if possible, what to correct

Best practices:
- Ensure ID images are clear and match the resident’s profile.
- Use consistent criteria for approval to maintain fairness.

---

## Document Requests
Purpose: process resident requests for certificates and clearances.

Workflow:
1. Open Requests (Documents).
2. Filter by status (e.g., pending, processing, ready, completed, rejected).
3. Use Edit to refine content: adjust Purpose, Remarks or Additional Information, Civil Status, and Age before generation.
4. Open a request to see details: resident info, type, purpose, attachments.
5. Actions:
   - Approve (Digital): generate the official PDF document (digital-only); status advances to ready when successful
   - Approve (Pickup): move through processing to completed; coordinate pickup
   - Reject: provide a clear reason
   - Update status as needed
6. Share/Download: for digital documents, you can download the generated PDF and, if policy allows, share the secure link with the resident.

Tips:
- Keep admin notes concise and professional; they may be referenced later.
- Use the Edit dialog to reword resident text for a professional tone; the generated document uses your edits.
- Use consistent document naming and ensure the correct document type was selected.

---

## Issue Management
Purpose: track, communicate, and resolve community-reported issues.

Workflow:
1. Open Issues.
2. Filter by category or status (submitted/pending/active/resolved, as available).
3. Open an issue to view details, attachments, and location information.
4. Update status and add responses for the resident/public record.

Best practices:
- Prioritize by severity and public safety.
- Provide clear updates to inform residents about progress.
- Common statuses: submitted, under_review, in_progress, resolved, closed, rejected.

---

## Marketplace Moderation
Purpose: review community listings before they appear publicly.

What changed:
- Listings created by residents now start as pending and are not publicly visible.
- Approve moves a listing to available (published). Reject returns it to the resident.
- The moderation view defaults to Pending. Switch the status filter to see Available or Rejected.

Workflow:
1. Open Marketplace.
2. In Pending Review, open a card → Review to see details and photos.
3. Approve (publishes as available) or Reject with a short reason.
4. Statistics reflect Available as approved items.

Notes:
- Transactions (accept/reject of requests) are handled by residents. When a seller accepts a request, the item automatically becomes reserved.
- Item statuses you may see: pending, available, rejected, reserved, completed, cancelled.
- Marketplace activity is scoped to your municipality.

---

## Announcements
Purpose: publish municipal news and updates.

Workflow:
1. Open Announcements.
2. Create a new announcement: title, content, and optional media.
3. Publish. Announcements appear in the Resident portal for your municipality.
4. Edit or archive outdated items.

Tips:
- Keep titles concise and informative.
- Add clear call-to-actions (dates, contact details, or linked forms where appropriate).

---

## Benefits & Programs
Purpose: manage assistance programs (eligibility, instructions, visibility).

Workflow:
1. Open Benefits.
2. Add or update programs with clear criteria and application steps.
3. Publish to make visible to residents.

Best practices:
- Keep program descriptions up to date.
- Include application deadlines and contact points.

---

## Reports & Analytics
Purpose: monitor platform usage and service delivery performance.

Common metrics:
- User growth and verification counts
- Document request volumes and completion rates
- Issue counts by category/status
- Marketplace listing flow

Use these to track trends and plan resources.

---

## Admin Profile & Security
- Update your profile details as needed.
- Protect credentials; sign out from shared devices.
- Follow LGU policies for data privacy and records handling.

Incident handling:
- If you detect misuse or data concerns, escalate to your municipal IT/security lead immediately.

---

## Troubleshooting

- I can’t log in to the Admin Portal
  - Confirm you’re on the Admin URL (single admin portal), not the Resident site.
  - Verify your credentials and role. If access is missing, contact your municipal IT lead.

- Requests/Issues/Marketplace look empty
  - Check the status filter (e.g., Pending, Available, Rejected) and date range.
  - Remember data is scoped to your municipality.
  - Refresh the page to reload data.

- PDF generation failed for a document request
  - PDFs apply only to Digital requests.
  - The request must belong to your municipality.
  - Try again. If it persists, capture the Request ID and time, then escalate.

- Marketplace moderation shows no items to review
  - Ensure the filter is set to Pending.
  - Listings appear here only before publication; residents manage transactions after approval.

- Issue status updates are not saving
  - Choose a valid status and try again.
  - Check network connectivity and reload the issue detail.

- Announcements not visible to residents
  - Ensure it’s published and scoped correctly to your municipality.
  - Residents must select your municipality in their selector.

- Reports/Analytics show zeros
  - Try a longer date range and confirm recent activity exists.

## Support & Escalation
- First line: your municipal MunLink coordinator or IT team
- Provide request/issue IDs, resident usernames, dates, and screenshots when reporting problems
